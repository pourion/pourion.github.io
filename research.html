<h5 >Computational Physical Simulations and Modeling</h5>

<p >
I am interested in developing mathematical models and scientific softwares for studying multiscale phenomena. 
The ultimate goal of my research is developing reduced order mathematical models based on direct (& compute-expensive) numerical simulations. 
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~mholst/pubs/dist/Hols94d.pdf5" style="color:darkgreen">Holst (1994)</a>, "steps required to solve a scientific problem of current 
interest using modern computers [involve]:
<ul>
<li>(1) Statement of the physical problem as a governing system of equations</li>
<li>(2) Analysis of the properties of the governing system</li>
<li>(3) Construction and analysis of an approximating system</li>
<li>(4) Development and analysis of numerical methods for the approximating system</li>
<li>(5) Efficient implementation of the numerical methods on sequential or parallel computers</li>
<li>(6) Analysis of the results."</li>
</ul>
At different stages of my career I have focused on any of these steps.

			<h6>Formation and Evolution of Dwarf Galaxies</h6>
				<h6>Computational Astrophysics</h6>
				<p>
					Galaxy clusters contain a large population of low-mass dwarf elliptical galaxies whose exact origin is unclear: their colours, structural properties and kinematics differ substantially from those of dwarf irregulars in the field. 
					We use the Illustris cosmological simulation to study differences in the assembly histories of dwarf galaxies (3 × 10^8 < M*/M⊙ < 10^10) according to their environment. We find that cluster dwarfs achieve their maximum total and 
					stellar mass on average ∼8 and ∼4.5 Gyr ago (or redshifts z = 1.0 and 0.4, respectively), around the time of infall into the clusters. In contrast, field dwarfs not subjected to environmental stripping reach their maximum mass at
					z = 0. These different assembly trajectories naturally produce a colour bimodality, with blue isolated dwarfs and redder cluster dwarfs exhibiting negligible star formation today. The cessation of star formation happens over median 
					times 3.5–5 Gyr depending on stellar mass, and shows a large scatter (∼1–8 Gyr), with the lower values associated with starburst events that occur at infall through the virial radius or pericentric passages. We argue that such starbursts 
					together with the early assembly of cluster dwarfs can provide a natural explanation for the higher specific frequency of globular clusters (GCs) in cluster dwarfs, as found observationally. 
					We present a simple model for the formation and stripping of GCs that supports this interpretation. The origin of dwarf ellipticals in clusters is, therefore, consistent with an environmentally driven evolution of field dwarf irregulars. 
					However, the z = 0 field analogues of cluster dwarf progenitors have today stellar masses a factor of ∼3 larger – a difference arising from the early truncation of star formation in cluster dwarfs.
