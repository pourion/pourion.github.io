      <h5>Computational Physical Simulations and Modeling</h5>

      <p>
        I am interested in developing mathematical models and scientific softwares for studying multiscale phenomena.
        The ultimate goal of my research is developing reduced order mathematical models based on direct (&
        compute-expensive) numerical simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Holst (1994), "steps required to solve a scientific problem of current
        interest using modern computers [involve]:
      <ul>
        <li>(1) Statement of the physical problem as a governing system of equations</li>
        <li>(2) Analysis of the properties of the governing system</li>
        <li>(3) Construction and analysis of an approximating system</li>
        <li>(4) Development and analysis of numerical methods for the approximating system</li>
        <li>(5) Efficient implementation of the numerical methods on sequential or parallel computers</li>
        <li>(6) Analysis of the results."</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At different stages of my career I have focused on any of these steps. </p>

          <h4>Neuro-Symbolic PDE Solver</h4>
          <p>

            We present a scalable strategy for development of mesh-free hybrid neuro-symbolic partial differential
            equation solvers based on existing mesh-based numerical discretization methods. Particularly, this strategy
            can be used to efficiently train neural network surrogate models for the solution functions and operators of
            partial differential equations while retaining the accuracy and convergence properties of the
            state-of-the-art numerical solvers. The presented neural bootstrapping method (hereby dubbed NBM) is based
            on evaluation of the finite discretization residuals of the PDE system obtained on implicit Cartesian cells
            centered on a set of random collocation points with respect to trainable parameters of the neural network.
            We apply NBM to the important class of elliptic problems with jump conditions across irregular interfaces in
            three spatial dimensions. We show the method is convergent such that model accuracy improves by increasing
            number of collocation points in the domain. The algorithms presented here are implemented and released in a
            software package named JAX-DIPS, standing for differentiable interfacial PDE solver.
            JAX-DIPS is purely developed in JAX, offering end-to-end differentiability from mesh generation to the
            higher level discretization abstractions, geometric integrations, and interpolations, thus facilitating
            research into use of differentiable algorithms for developing hybrid PDE solvers.

          <h4>Computational Astrophysics: Formation and Evolution of Dwarf Galaxies</h4>
          <p>
            Galaxy clusters contain a large population of low-mass dwarf elliptical galaxies whose exact origin is
            unclear: their colours, structural properties and kinematics differ substantially from those of dwarf
            irregulars in the field.
            We use the Illustris cosmological simulation to study differences in the assembly histories of dwarf
            galaxies (3 × 10^8 < M*/M⊙ < 10^10) according to their environment. We find that cluster dwarfs achieve
              their maximum total and stellar mass on average ∼8 and ∼4.5 Gyr ago (or redshifts z=1.0 and 0.4,
              respectively), around the time of infall into the clusters. In contrast, field dwarfs not subjected to
              environmental stripping reach their maximum mass at z=0. These different assembly trajectories naturally
              produce a colour bimodality, with blue isolated dwarfs and redder cluster dwarfs exhibiting negligible
              star formation today. The cessation of star formation happens over median times 3.5–5 Gyr depending on
              stellar mass, and shows a large scatter (∼1–8 Gyr), with the lower values associated with starburst events
              that occur at infall through the virial radius or pericentric passages. We argue that such starbursts
              together with the early assembly of cluster dwarfs can provide a natural explanation for the higher
              specific frequency of globular clusters (GCs) in cluster dwarfs, as found observationally. We present a
              simple model for the formation and stripping of GCs that supports this interpretation. The origin of dwarf
              ellipticals in clusters is, therefore, consistent with an environmentally driven evolution of field dwarf
              irregulars. However, the z=0 field analogues of cluster dwarf progenitors have today stellar masses a
              factor of ∼3 larger – a difference arising from the early truncation of star formation in cluster dwarfs.
