<h5>Computational Physical Simulations and Modeling</h5>

<p>
I am interested in developing models, implementing high performance scientific softwares to perform multi-scale simulations, and produce large scientific datasets. 
The overarching goal of all my projects is to develop physical models from data. I am generally interested in the following topics:
	      <ul>
		      	<li> High performance scientific computing, </li>
			<li> Sharp interface physics,</li>
		      	<li> Complex systems,</li>
		        <li> Inverse statistical physics.</li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      During the past few years my research interests have largely been steered towards an old topic called "Bioelectricity". 
	      
	      Michael Faraday (1839) describes this field,
	    <p></p>
	      <p class="lead"> "Wonderful as are the laws and phenomena of electricity when made evident to us in
		inorganic or dead matter, their interest can bear scarcely any comparison with that which
		attaches to the same force when connected with the nervous system and with life." <p>
		<p></p>
		For an early review of this field have a look at <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.bb.06.060177.002305" style="color:darkgreen">Jaffe and Nuccittelli (1977)</a>

				<h6>Galactic Cultures: Formation and Evolution of Dwarf Galaxies</h6>
				<h6>Computational Astrophysics</h6>
				<p>
					Galaxy clusters contain a large population of low-mass dwarf elliptical galaxies whose exact origin is unclear: their colours, structural properties and kinematics differ substantially from those of dwarf irregulars in the field. 
					We use the Illustris cosmological simulation to study differences in the assembly histories of dwarf galaxies (3 × 10^8 < M*/M⊙ < 10^10) according to their environment. We find that cluster dwarfs achieve their maximum total and 
					stellar mass on average ∼8 and ∼4.5 Gyr ago (or redshifts z = 1.0 and 0.4, respectively), around the time of infall into the clusters. In contrast, field dwarfs not subjected to environmental stripping reach their maximum mass at
					z = 0. These different assembly trajectories naturally produce a colour bimodality, with blue isolated dwarfs and redder cluster dwarfs exhibiting negligible star formation today. The cessation of star formation happens over median 
					times 3.5–5 Gyr depending on stellar mass, and shows a large scatter (∼1–8 Gyr), with the lower values associated with starburst events that occur at infall through the virial radius or pericentric passages. We argue that such starbursts 
					together with the early assembly of cluster dwarfs can provide a natural explanation for the higher specific frequency of globular clusters (GCs) in cluster dwarfs, as found observationally. 
					We present a simple model for the formation and stripping of GCs that supports this interpretation. The origin of dwarf ellipticals in clusters is, therefore, consistent with an environmentally driven evolution of field dwarf irregulars. 
					However, the z = 0 field analogues of cluster dwarf progenitors have today stellar masses a factor of ∼3 larger – a difference arising from the early truncation of star formation in cluster dwarfs.
